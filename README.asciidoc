== `gnome extensions`

GNOME Shell Extensions that I made or maintained.

Different branch for different extension.

=== ATTENTION

All the extensions are designed specifically FOR MYSELF. That's why there
are no prefs settings in there. I just made my preference into the code.

They are only guaranteed to work on my system, which runs Arch Linux, thus
having the latest version of GNOME Shell.

=== How to Install
